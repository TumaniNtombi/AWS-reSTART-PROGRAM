# 3D E-Commerce Platform on AWS â€” Architecture Documentation

## 1. Overview
This platform enables users to interact with **3D models of products globally**. It is designed to deliver **high performance, availability, and security** while being **cost-efficient**. The architecture leverages AWS services for **static asset storage, dynamic APIs, real-time services, and global distribution**.

## 2. Architecture Components

| Layer / Domain | Service(s) | Role & Justification |
|----------------|------------|--------------------|
| **Front-End & Global Delivery** | Users (Web & Mobile via HTTP/3 over QUIC with TLS) | Entry point for clients, leveraging modern, secure protocols for faster connections. |
| | Amazon Route 53 | DNS resolution, traffic routing, and failover across AZs and regions. |
| | Amazon CloudFront + WAF | Global CDN caching to reduce latency and protect applications before requests reach ALBs. |
| **Static & Dynamic Content** | Amazon S3 | Durable object storage for static assets, backups, and uploads with versioning, lifecycle policies, and SDK integration. |
| **Compute** | Elastic Load Balancer (ALB/NLB) | Distributes HTTP/HTTPS traffic. ALB supports Layer 7 routing, WebSocket, and content-based routing. Two ALBs: one for web tier, one for app tier, across multi-AZ deployments. |
| | Auto Scaling | Dynamically scales EC2/web servers behind ALBs for performance and cost efficiency. |
| | AWS Batch | Event-driven and batch processing (asset pipelines), integrated with SQS, SNS, and EventBridge. |
| **Data Layer** | Amazon DynamoDB (Global Tables) | Serverless NoSQL DB for catalogs, carts, and sessions with multi-region replication for low latency. |
| | Amazon Aurora (Global Database) | Relational DB for orders/payments with ACID compliance and global failover. |
| | Amazon ElastiCache (Redis) | In-memory cache for low-latency queries and reducing DB load. |
| | Amazon OpenSearch | Full-text search and analytics for product discovery and filtering. |
| **Security & Identity** | Amazon Cognito | Authentication & authorization with MFA, social login, and JWTs. |
| | AWS KMS & Secrets Manager | Encryption at rest (KMS) and secure credential management with rotation. |
| | AWS WAF & AWS Shield | OWASP protection and managed DDoS defense. |
| | Networking Controls | Private subnets, SGs, NACLs, VPC Endpoints to isolate workloads and enforce least privilege. |
| **Observability** | Amazon CloudWatch | Metrics, logging, and alarms for system health monitoring. |
| | AWS X-Ray | Distributed tracing for performance bottlenecks. |
| | AWS CloudTrail | API call logging for audit/compliance. |
| | AWS Trusted Advisor | Best-practice checks for cost, security, performance, and fault tolerance. |

## 3. How the Architecture Meets Key Requirements

| Requirement | Implementation | Justification |
|------------|----------------|---------------|
| High Availability | Multi-AZ deployments, CloudFront edge caching, Route 53 failover, DynamoDB Global Tables, Aurora Global DB | Ensures resilience across regions, reduces downtime, and provides global access to data with minimal disruption. |
| Scalability | Auto-scaling (Lambda), CloudFront, on-demand DynamoDB, Aurora Serverless v2, SQS decoupling | Supports unpredictable workloads by scaling resources dynamically while preventing bottlenecks. |
| Performance | Optimized 3D assets, HTTP/3 delivery via CloudFront, ElastiCache, global DB replicas | Improves speed and responsiveness for global users by reducing latency and delivering cached content. |
| Security | IAM least-privilege, Cognito with MFA, WAF & Shield, KMS encryption, private subnets | Protects system and data with strong authentication, encryption, and network isolation. |
| Cost Optimization | Serverless, S3 Intelligent-Tiering + Glacier, Spot Instances, CloudFront caching, Savings Plans | Reduces waste by paying only for what is used and leveraging discounted resources. |

## 4. Design Trade-Offs & Considerations

| Area | Trade-Off / Challenge | Mitigation / Rationale |
|------|--------------------|----------------------|
| Compute Choice (EC2 vs Lambda) | EC2 provides high control and handles heavy workloads but can be costly and slow to scale. Lambda is cost-efficient but has execution limits. | Use EC2 for compute-heavy rendering or batch tasks; use Lambda for lightweight, event-driven tasks. This hybrid approach balances cost and performance. |
| Database Design (DynamoDB vs Aurora) | DynamoDB is ultra-fast for NoSQL but limited for complex queries. Aurora supports relational data but is costlier for multi-region scaling. | Use DynamoDB for catalogs, sessions, and carts; Aurora Global Database for orders/payments requiring strong consistency. |
| Global Delivery vs Consistency | CloudFront caching improves performance but may serve slightly stale 3D assets. | Implement proper cache invalidation and S3 versioning. |
| Security vs Usability | Strong security may increase friction for developers/users. | Balance usability with MFA, social login, Cognito user pools, and streamlined private networking. |
| Cost Optimization vs Performance | Spot Instances, serv
